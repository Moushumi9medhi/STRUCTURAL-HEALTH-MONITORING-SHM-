This is the official repository of the paper titled "Real-Time Video Surveillance Based Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures Using Artificial Neural Network".



We present a computer vision based non-destructive structural health monitoring (SHM) method using high speed video imaging system. We trained an artificial neural network to infer the qualitative characteristics of structural vibrations based on vibration intensity. The efficacy of our vision system in remote measurement of dynamic displacements was demonstrated through laboratory experiments (e.g., shaking table, slip desk).
